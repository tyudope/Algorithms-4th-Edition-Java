# Algorithms, 4th Edition (Java Implementation)

This repository contains my Java implementations and exercise solutions for *Algorithms (4th Edition)* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## 📚 Chapters Covered

- [ ] Chapter 1: Fundamentals
- [ ] Chapter 2: Sorting
- [ ] Chapter 3: Searching
- [ ] Chapter 4: Graphs
- [ ] Chapter 5: Strings
- [ ] Chapter 6: Context

## 🧠 Goal

To build a deep understanding of classical algorithms and data structures by implementing all examples and selected exercises from the book.

## 📁 Structure

```

Each chapter will include:
- Java implementations of key algorithms and data structures
- Comments explaining logic and complexity
- Exercise solutions (when applicable)

## Progress
Progress will be updated in this README as I go through the book chapter by chapter. it will be continue.
